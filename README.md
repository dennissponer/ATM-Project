# ATM-Project
This is a simple project for my MIT Full Stack Development Class. This project allows one to add or deduct "money" from a ficticious bank account. If the balance goes below zero, it prevents one from withdrawing more money. I spent some time practicing with the functionality as well as the colors that are displayed.
